## Features

- Defaults to a simple "Mean Score" of other percentages
  - I couldn't tell which individual metric was best
  - I don't want a fancy equation that allows me just to get the results I want
- Change y axis metric without changing language selections
- Provide access to all languages in the dataset
- Link to GitHub topics and trending repos by language
- Permalink to Languish configured selections and metric
- *Limitation:* Works on my phone, but not carefully tailored for mobile
